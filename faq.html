                <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
                
                <div class="faq-section">
                    <p><span class="emphasis">When will I hear back about my application?</span><br>
                    All admitted fellows for the 2025 cycle have already been notified.</p>

                    <p><span class="emphasis">Has this been run before?</span><br>
                    Odyssey is heavily inspired by the Polaris Fellowship, which was run by Entrepreneur First in 2023-2024. The cohort leaders are past Polaris cohort leads and have experience organizing the dinners and leading discussions. However, it is not an exact copy (in particular, there is no agreement that gives Entrepreneur First a right to invest in companies; we are an entirely independent organisation).</p>

                    <p><span class="emphasis">How is Odyssey funded?</span><br>
                    The Odyssey organisers have sourced no-strings-attached grants from several donors who want to support ambitious and unconventional efforts to improve the world, and believe that cultivating peer groups and culture is important for this. Funders have no control over the programme or the fellows.</p>

                    <p><span class="emphasis">How many hours per week should I dedicate to the programme?</span><br>
                    The fellowship is divided into two phases. During the first phase (3 months), you will read about 100 pages per week (from a mixture of books and essays), and then have a weekly (free!) dinner during which we meet to discuss the readings and get to know your peers. The second phase of the programme is less structured, and is meant as your opportunity to pursue ambitious work that wouldn't have otherwise existed, perhaps with some of the people you've met. Apart from standing get-togethers and dinners, the time is yours to spend wisely. There will also be a transition between the two phases to help you brainstorm and get started on turning inspirations from the first phase into action.</p>

                    <p><span class="emphasis">What age will participants be?</span><br>
                    We expect that most fellows will be 18-30, but there is no upper age limit. The Oxford and Cambridge cohorts will likely be more skewed towards students (from undergraduate to postgraduate), while the London cohort will include many professionals.</p>

                    <p><span class="emphasis">I'm still a student. Will the programme run according to term dates and will it continue over summer?</span><br>
                    Yes. The first phase of the programme will run during university term time for the benefit of those who are still studying.</p>

                    <p><span class="emphasis">Will we recieve funding for our projects?</span><br>
                    There will be funding avaliable for supplies, credits, and miscellaneous costs to help projects get off the ground. Near the end of the program, we have an angel ready to fund fellow's nascent projects and a VC for those looking to raise pre-seed or seed. However, there is no commitment to do so, and it is not at all required you work on anything startup-shaped.</p>

                    <p><span class="emphasis">Can I join if I am leaving the UK this summer?</span><br>
                    We welcome all applicants as long as they're here for the first phase of the programme, which lasts until April.</p>

                    <p><span class="emphasis">What's the difference between the different cohorts?</span><br>
                    The curriculum and discussions will be shaped by the fellows at each university but the vision is the same. Termly dinners will be held where all Odyssey Fellows will intermix.</p>

                    <p><span class="emphasis">What does the reading list look like?</span><br>
                    The reading list is an eclectic mix of essays and books. We expect there will be much that is new, regardless of your background. Here's a link to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S0s5fbbX7iH44sFny8TwcapXKOM7-AFa45yz5SZhoMI/edit?usp=sharing" class="custom-link">introduction</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oV4y81Z3V1cZwcmuVdI4jUfNFFgcRsrIsXCfw952pBM/edit?usp=sharing" class="custom-link">a week on cyberculture</a>, <!--<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F0NljNAc8TNIPY6KA4RfG8sHF-jJj04RQuT43lz8Woc/edit?usp=sharing"</a>--><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bpzOJgD1zkXBKSf--DBJUvNbcTHDyNhULXOjzaV7gK4/edit?usp=sharing" class="custom-link">conclusion</a> as a taster.</p>

                    <p><span class="emphasis">Can my friends at other universities or cities join Odyssey?</span><br>
                    Odyssey is running in Oxford, Cambridge, and London. It is not at all limited to students studying at universities in these places, however participants must be able to attend weekly cohort meetings in-person in those cities.</p>

                    <p><span class="emphasis">Am I eligible for Odyssey if I am not in the UK?</span><br>
                    We do not support people to relocate for the fellowship.</p>

                    <p><span class="emphasis">What if I can't attend an in-person session?</span><br>
                    We expect all fellows to attend weekly sessions in-person when in town. Odyssey isn't a university class, we won't be taking attendance, however it is up to the Cohort lead's discretion whether a frequently absent participant remains on the programme. All participants will have access to a chat where they will be expected to flag if they cannot attend a specific session.</p>

                    <p><span class="emphasis">I don't attend university, can I still apply?</span><br>
                    The programme is open to talented people, regardless of what stage in life they are. We are happy to welcome everyone from undergraduates to PhD students to working professionals.</p>
