                    <p><span class="emphasis">How many hours should I dedicate?</span><br>
                    The fellowship is divided into two phases. During the first phase (3 months), you will dedicate one evening a week to meeting with fellows, plus 1-2 hours daily for readings. The second phase gives you freedom to pursue ambitious work, with only fortnightly meetings required.</p>
                    
                    <p><span class="emphasis">How does the financial support work?</span><br>
                    Books for the first phase are provided. During the second phase, we support your projects with materials funding. We have high risk tolerance and take our responsibility seriously to not dampen exploration through process or delays.</p>
                    
                    <p><span class="emphasis">What's the programme structure?</span><br>
                    • First 3 months: Weekly meetings and curriculum exploration<br>
                    • Following 6 months: Free rein for your projects<br>
                    • Regular standing get-togethers and dinners<br>
                    • Dedicated Community Leaders for guidance<br>
                    • Access to a broad network of founders, researchers, and thinkers</p>

                    <p><span class="emphasis">Who can apply?</span><br>
                    The programme is open to talented people, from high school dropouts to final year PhDs. We welcome undergraduates, recent graduates, Masters and PhD students and external applicants.</p>

                    <p><span class="emphasis">Is this an entrepreneurship program?</span><br>
                    While we're eager to help you start a company if that's your path, this is not an entrepreneurship programme. We are here to help you find your life's work, whatever it turns out to look like.</p>
