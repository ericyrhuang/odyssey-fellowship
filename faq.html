                <div class="faq-section">
                    <p><span class="emphasis">How many hours per week should I dedicate to the programme?</span><br>
                    The fellowship is divided into two phases. During the first phase (3 months), you will be expected to dedicate one evening a week to meeting with the fellows, and there will be readings which take approximately 1 or 2 hours a day to complete. The second phase of the programme is your opportunity to pursue ambitious work. Apart from a fortnightly meeting, the time is yours to spend wisely.</p>

                    <p><span class="emphasis">Has this been run before?</span><br>
                    Odyssey is heavily inspired by the Polaris Fellowship. The cohort leaders are past Polaris community leaders and have experience organizing the dinners and leading discussions. However, there will be some significant differences between the Odyssey and Polaris fellowships.</p>

                    <p><span class="emphasis">Will the programme run according to term dates and will it continue over summer?</span><br>
                    Yes. The first phase of the programme will run during term time, and will be organised around the holidays. Over the summer, you will be working on your own projects - you can decide when and how you manage this alongside your studies.</p>

                    <p><span class="emphasis">What's the difference between the Oxford and Cambridge cohorts?</span><br>
                    The curriculum and discussions will be shaped by the fellows at each university but the vision is the same. Termly dinners will be held where all Odyssey Fellows will intermix.</p>

                    <p><span class="emphasis">Can I join if I am graduating over summer and leaving UK?</span><br>
                    We welcome all applicants as long as they're here for the first phase of the programme.</p>

                    <p><span class="emphasis">Can my friends at other universities join Odyssey?</span><br>
                    Odyssey is running in Oxford and Cambridge. It is not limited to students studying at universities in these places, however participants must be able to attend weekly cohort meetings in-person.</p>

                    <p><span class="emphasis">Am I eligible for Odyssey if I am not in the UK?</span><br>
                    We do not support people to relocate for the fellowship.</p>

                    <p><span class="emphasis">What if I can't attend an in-person session?</span><br>
                    We require all fellows to attend weekly sessions in-person. Odyssey isn't a university class, we won't be taking attendance, however it is up to the Community Leader's discretion whether a frequently absent participant remains on the programme. All participants will have access to a Slack channel and will be expected to flag if they cannot attend a specific session.</p>

                    <p><span class="emphasis">I don't attend university, can I still apply?</span><br>
                    The programme is open to talented people, from high school dropouts to final year PhDs. We are happy to welcome undergraduates, recent graduates, Masters and PhD students and external applicants onto the Odyssey programme.</p>

                    <p><span class="emphasis">When will I hear back about my application?</span><br>
                    We will be reviewing applications and conducting interviews on a rolling basis starting from January 6th. The application window closes on January 16th. We are reviewing applications and interviewing in batches, and so during busy periods, you might not hear from us for one to two weeks.</p>
