                        <p><span class="emphasis">Few things matter more than what the world’s most talented individuals do with their lives.</span></p>
                        
                        <p>Unfortunately, discovering the path which will lead them to the right life’s work is seldom straightforward, and the process is too often hampered by institutions which promise clarity and direction only to deliver a narrow list of sanitised options within which work is primarily justified as preparation for eventual real, impactful work, to be taken on later, elsewhere.</p>
                        
                        <p>Even for those individuals who resist the dampening pressures the world throws on the ambitious and the weird, transforming fuzzy aspirations into concrete action on one’s own is a painful process prone to failure because the expression of talent is fundamentally social.</p>
                        
                        <p>The right peers hold you accountable, egg you on, raise your aspirations, and ultimately enable you to progress. <span class="emphasis">But forming such a peer group is rare and difficult, even when embedded within institutions which gather the world’s smartest and most ambitious people.</span></p>
                        
                        <p>History is proof of the fact that these peer groups matter immensely. The most interesting and impactful work rarely starts within the brightly illuminated and fully legible spaces curated by universities and other institutions of becoming.</p>
                        
                        <p>Instead, it happens in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caf%C3%A9_Guerbois" class="custom-link">Café Guerbois</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tech_Model_Railroad_Club">after hours in room 20E-214</a>, or late into the night at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Inklings">the Eagle and Child pub</a>.</p>
                        
                        <p>These are spaces where bad ideas, incomplete thoughts, and cringe obsessions are taken seriously, allowed to be explored and played with. They are also spaces of high expectations and competition. They are, in other words, spaces of radicalisation, where individuals and groups shape and concretise an idea until they feel impelled to action.</p>

                        <p>The Odyssey curriculum is a deep dive into the very early days of some of the groups and movements which have come to define our present.</p>
                        <p>From our privileged position, <span class="emphasis">their visions for the future seem obvious; we regularly fail to remember that the edifices they built over decades or millennia started as messy projects pursued by marginal people</span>, seen by their contemporaries as unserious, cringe-worthy, radical, and dangerous.</p>
                        <p>Over the first 11 weeks of the fellowship, we will be meeting as a group to discuss the ways our distance from the past might mislead us about our ability to impact the future. Our exploration of the early days of the Enlightenment, the arrival of the Counterculture, and the emergence of Cyberculture will give us stories, anecdotes, and frames with which to interpret the present, and give you more context and better judgement with which to think about your future.</p>
